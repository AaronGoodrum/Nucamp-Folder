<h3 align="center">Week 2</h3>
<h4 align="center">HTML CSS and JavaScript Course</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ready to move to Week 2!</strong></p>
<p>This week, you will begin to learn JavaScript. This includes the fundamental components of most programming languages such as variables, arrays, making decisions, loops, events and functions, as well as the generation of random numbers. </p>
<p>Watch all the videos and do the exercises by Saturday December 2nd, when we will all get together to work on this secondâ€™s week assignment, the development of a color guessing game.</p>

<li><strong><u><a href="https://learn.nucamp.co/course/view.php?id=2&amp;section=3" target="_blank">Watch the week 2 lectures:</a></u></strong> do that anytime during the week, but make sure to be done by Saturday 2nd to be ready for the in-person workshop.</li>
<li><strong>Practice the code you see in the videos </strong>- you'll learn faster and deeper by write code yourself.</li>
<li><u><strong><a href="https://learn.nucamp.co/mod/forum/view.php?id=31" target="_blank">Ask and answer questions in the week 2 forums.</a></strong></u> Myself and Ludo will monitor it several times a day and will jump-in to help when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Reach out directly to me (or Ludo) if you're stuck</strong>. Use the messaging feature. Don't forget the 20 minutes rule though: you should work on figuring out the solution on your own for 20 minutes before asking for help.</li>
<li><u><strong><a href="https://learn.nucamp.co/mod/workshop/view.php?id=28" target="_blank">Read the Workshop instructions</a></strong> </u>- read them thoroughly for now, since we will be doing the project on Saturday. Print them if you can.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy learning and see you all tomorrow!</p>

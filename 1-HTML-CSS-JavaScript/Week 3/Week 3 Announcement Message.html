<h4 align="center">HTML CSS and JavaScript Course</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><b>This is the last week of the course, Week 3!&nbsp;</b><p>This week, you will explore
advanced JavaScript loop control and begin to learn the Document Object Model
(aka DOM) and how to manipulate it. You will then learn about events, mouse and
timers and advanced function handling techniques.</p><p></p>
<p>Watch all the videos and do the exercises by Saturday December 9th, when we will all get together to work on this third and last week assignment, the development of a matching game.</p>

<li><strong><u><a href="https://learn.nucamp.co/course/view.php?id=2&amp;section=4" target="_blank">Watch the week 3 lectures:</a></u></strong> do that anytime during the week, but make sure to be done by Saturday 9th to be ready for the in-person workshop.</li>
<li><strong>Practice the code you see in the videos </strong>- you'll learn faster and deeper by write code yourself.</li>
<li><u><strong><a href="https://learn.nucamp.co/mod/forum/view.php?id=32" target="_blank">Ask and answer questions in the week 3 forums.</a></strong></u> Myself and Ludo will monitor it several times a day and will jump-in to help when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Reach out directly to me (or Ludo) if you're stuck</strong>. Use the messaging feature. Don't forget the 20 minutes rule though: you should work on figuring out the solution on your own for 20 minutes before asking for help.</li>
<li><u><strong><a href="https://learn.nucamp.co/mod/assign/view.php?id=109" target="_blank">Watch the video and read the Assignment instructions</a></strong> </u>- read them thoroughly for now, since we will be doing the project on Saturday. Print them if you can.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy learning and see you all tomorrow!</p>
